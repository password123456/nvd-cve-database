# Disclaimer
We provide streamlined data by selectively extracting essential components from the original CVE information without altering the source data.

In cases where there are errors in the original CVE source data, such errors may also manifest in the CVE data within this repository. Additionally, interruptions or system downtimes in the original CVE source may lead to the omission of some CVE-IDs.

Please be aware that we do not operate a system of 1000% integrity synchronization with the original CVE sources.
We suggest being aware of the potential consequences that may arise from such situations.
We are confident that the information in this repository is free of issues in typical circumstances.
