This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on form submissions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit forms intended for public use as another user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. On sites where unfiltered_html is enabled, this can lead to the admin unknowingly adding a Stored Cross-Site Scripting payload.",
