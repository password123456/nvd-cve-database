        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nfsnotify: clear PARENT_WATCHED flags lazily\nIn some setups directories can have many (usually negative) dentries.\nHence __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() function can take a\nsignificant amount of time. Since the bulk of this function happens\nunder inode->i_lock this causes a significant contention on the lock\nwhen we remove the watch from the directory as the\n__fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() call from fsnotify_recalc_mask()\nraces with __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() calls from\n__fsnotify_parent() happening on children. This can lead upto softlockup\nreports reported by users.\nFix the problem by calling fsnotify_update_children_dentry_flags() to\nset PARENT_WATCHED flags only when parent starts watching children.\nWhen parent stops watching children, clear false positive PARENT_WATCHED\nflags lazily in __fsnotify_parent() for each accessed child.",

This causes page cache operations to\nhang waiting for the writeback flag.  For example,\ntruncate_inode_pages_final(), which is called via nilfs_evict_inode() when\nan inode is evicted from memory, will hang.\nSecond, the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag set on normal inodes remain uncleared. \nAs a result, if the next log write involves checkpoint creation, that's\nfine, but if a partial log write is performed that does not, inodes with\nNILFS_I_COLLECTED set are erroneously removed from the \"sc_dirty_files\"\nlist, and their data and b-tree blocks may not be written to the device,\ncorrupting the block mapping.\nFix these issues by uniformly calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction()\non failure of each step in the loop in nilfs_segctor_do_construct(),\nhaving it clean up logs and segment usages according to progress, and\ncorrecting the conditions for calling nilfs_redirty_inodes() to ensure\nthat the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag is cleared.",
