This will crash as Tink just assumes any valid JSON input will contain an object.\n  *  An adversary can crash binaries using the crypto::tink::JsonKeysetReader in tink-cc by providing an input containing many nested JSON objects. This may result in a stack overflow.\nWe recommend upgrading to version 2.1.3 or above",
