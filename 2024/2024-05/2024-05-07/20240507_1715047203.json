        "description": "A race condition vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, specifically within the user invite acceptance process. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple concurrent requests to accept a single user invite, allowing the creation of multiple user accounts from a single invite link intended for only one user. This bypasses the intended security mechanism that restricts invite acceptance to a single user, leading to unauthorized user creation without detection in the invite tab. The issue is due to the lack of validation for concurrent requests in the backend.",
