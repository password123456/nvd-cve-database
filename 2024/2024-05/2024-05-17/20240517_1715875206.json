        "description": "Unlike 32-bit PV guests, HVM guests may switch freely between 64-bit and\nother modes.  This in particular means that they may set registers used\nto pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the range\n32-bit code would be able to set them to.\nWhen processing of hypercalls takes a considerable amount of time,\nthe hypervisor may choose to invoke a hypercall continuation.  Doing so\ninvolves putting (perhaps updated) hypercall arguments in respective\nregisters.  For guests not running in 64-bit mode this further involves\na certain amount of translation of the values.\nUnfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated values\nassumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking a\nhypercall.  When this is found not to be the case, it triggers a\nconsistency check in the hypervisor and causes a crash.",
