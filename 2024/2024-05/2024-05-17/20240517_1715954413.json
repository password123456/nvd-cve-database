When the NTB is parsed, unwrap call looks for\nany leftover bytes in SKB provided by u_ether and if there are any pending\nbytes, it treats them as a separate NTB and parses it. But in case the\nsecond NTB (as per unwrap call) is faulty/corrupt, all the datagrams that\nwere parsed properly in the first NTB and saved in rx_list are dropped.\nAdding a few custom traces showed the following:\n[002] d..1  7828.532866: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out:\nreq 000000003868811a length 1025/16384 zsI ==> 0\n[002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb toprocess: 1025\n[002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342\n[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb seq: 0xce67\n[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x400\n[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb ndp_len: 0x10\n[002] d..1  7828.532869: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: Parsed NTB with 1 frames\nIn this case, the giveback is of 1025 bytes and block length is 1024.\nThe rest 1 byte (which is 0x00) won't be parsed resulting in drop of\nall datagrams in rx_list.\nSame is case with packets of size 2048:\n[002] d..1  7828.557948: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out:\nreq 0000000011dfd96e length 2049/16384 zsI ==> 0\n[002] d..1  7828.557949: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342\n[002] d..1  7828.557950: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x800\nLecroy shows one byte coming in extra confirming that the byte is coming\nin from PC:\n Transfer 2959 - Bytes Transferred(1025)  Timestamp((18.524 843 590)\n - Transaction 8391 - Data(1025 bytes) Timestamp(18.524 843 590)\n --- Packet 4063861\n       Data(1024 bytes)\n       Duration(2.117us) Idle(14.700ns) Timestamp(18.524 843 590)\n --- Packet 4063863\n       Data(1 byte)\n       Duration(66.160ns) Time(282.000ns) Timestamp(18.524 845 722)\nAccording to Windows driver, no ZLP is needed if wBlockLength is non-zero,\nbecause the non-zero wBlockLength has already told the function side the\nsize of transfer to be expected.

In macvlan case, macvlan driver retains clone(s) of the mcast skb\n    and schedules a work queue to send them out on the lower devices.\n    The clone skb->_nfct is not a copy, it is the same entry as the\n    original skb.  The macvlan rx handler then returns RX_HANDLER_PASS.\n 5. Normal conntrack hooks (in NF_INET_LOCAL_IN) confirm the orig skb.\nThe Macvlan broadcast worker and normal confirm path will race.\nThis race will not happen if step 2 already confirmed a clone. In that\ncase later steps perform skb_clone() with skb->_nfct already confirmed (in\nhash table).  This works fine.\nBut such confirmation won't happen when eb/ip/nftables rules dropped the\npackets before they reached the nf_confirm step in postrouting.\nPablo points out that nf_conntrack_bridge doesn't allow use of stateful\nnat, so we can safely discard the nf_conn entry and let inet call\nconntrack again.\nThis doesn't work for bridge netfilter: skb could have a nat\ntransformation. Also bridge nf prevents re-invocation of inet prerouting\nvia 'sabotage_in' hook.\nWork around this problem by explicit confirmation of the entry at LOCAL_IN\ntime, before upper layer has a chance to clone the unconfirmed entry.\nThe downside is that this disables NAT and conntrack helpers.\nAlternative fix would be to add locking to all code parts that deal with\nunconfirmed packets, but even if that could be done in a sane way this\nopens up other problems, for example:\n-m physdev --physdev-out eth0 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.4\n-m physdev --physdev-out eth1 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.5\nFor multicast case, only one of such conflicting mappings will be\ncreated, conntrack only handles 1:1 NAT mappings.\nUsers should set create a setup that explicitly marks such traffic\nNOTRACK (conntrack bypass) to avoid this, but we cannot auto-bypass\nthem, ruleset might have accept rules for untracked traffic already,\nso user-visible behaviour would change.",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbtrfs: fix deadlock with fiemap and extent locking\nWhile working on the patchset to remove extent locking I got a lockdep\nsplat with fiemap and pagefaulting with my new extent lock replacement\nlock.\nThis deadlock exists with our normal code, we just don't have lockdep\nannotations with the extent locking so we've never noticed it.\nSince we're copying the fiemap extent to user space on every iteration\nwe have the chance of pagefaulting.  Because we hold the extent lock for\nthe entire range we could mkwrite into a range in the file that we have\nmmap'ed.  This would deadlock with the following stack trace\n[<0>] lock_extent+0x28d/0x2f0\n[<0>] btrfs_page_mkwrite+0x273/0x8a0\n[<0>] do_page_mkwrite+0x50/0xb0\n[<0>] do_fault+0xc1/0x7b0\n[<0>] __handle_mm_fault+0x2fa/0x460\n[<0>] handle_mm_fault+0xa4/0x330\n[<0>] do_user_addr_fault+0x1f4/0x800\n[<0>] exc_page_fault+0x7c/0x1e0\n[<0>] asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\n[<0>] rep_movs_alternative+0x33/0x70\n[<0>] _copy_to_user+0x49/0x70\n[<0>] fiemap_fill_next_extent+0xc8/0x120\n[<0>] emit_fiemap_extent+0x4d/0xa0\n[<0>] extent_fiemap+0x7f8/0xad0\n[<0>] btrfs_fiemap+0x49/0x80\n[<0>] __x64_sys_ioctl+0x3e1/0xb50\n[<0>] do_syscall_64+0x94/0x1a0\n[<0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x76\nI wrote an fstest to reproduce this deadlock without my replacement lock\nand verified that the deadlock exists with our existing locking.\nTo fix this simply don't take the extent lock for the entire duration of\nthe fiemap.  This is safe in general because we keep track of where we\nare when we're searching the tree, so if an ordered extent updates in\nthe middle of our fiemap call we'll still emit the correct extents\nbecause we know what offset we were on before.\nThe only place we maintain the lock is searching delalloc.  Since the\ndelalloc stuff can change during writeback we want to lock the extent\nrange so we have a consistent view of delalloc at the time we're\nchecking to see if we need to set the delalloc flag.\nWith this patch applied we no longer deadlock with my testcase.",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ndm-raid: really frozen sync_thread during suspend\n1) commit f52f5c71f3d4 (\"md: fix stopping sync thread\") remove\n   MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN from __md_stop_writes() and doesn't realize that\n   dm-raid relies on __md_stop_writes() to frozen sync_thread\n   indirectly. Fix this problem by adding MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN in\n   md_stop_writes(), and since stop_sync_thread() is only used for\n   dm-raid in this case, also move stop_sync_thread() to\n   md_stop_writes().\n2) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN doesn't mean that sync thread is frozen,\n   it only prevent new sync_thread to start, and it can't stop the\n   running sync thread; In order to frozen sync_thread, after seting the\n   flag, stop_sync_thread() should be used.\n3) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN doesn't mean that writes are stopped, use\n   it as condition for md_stop_writes() in raid_postsuspend() doesn't\n   look correct. Consider that reentrant stop_sync_thread() do nothing,\n   always call md_stop_writes() in raid_postsuspend().\n4) raid_message can set/clear the flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN at anytime,\n   and if MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is cleared while the array is suspended,\n   new sync_thread can start unexpected. Fix this by disallow\n   raid_message() to change sync_thread status during suspend.\nNote that after commit f52f5c71f3d4 (\"md: fix stopping sync thread\"), the\ntest shell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh start to hang in stop_sync_thread(),\nand with previous fixes, the test won't hang there anymore, however, the\ntest will still fail and complain that ext4 is corrupted. And with this\npatch, the test won't hang due to stop_sync_thread() or fail due to ext4\nis corrupted anymore. However, there is still a deadlock related to\ndm-raid456 that will be fixed in following patches.",
