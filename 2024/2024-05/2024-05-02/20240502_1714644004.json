Potentially, anyone can interact with the broker (using Jolokia JMX REST API) and/or produce/consume messages or purge/delete destinations (using the Message REST API).\nTo mitigate, users can update the default conf/jetty.xml configuration file to add authentication requirement:\n<bean id=\"securityConstraintMapping\" class=\"org.eclipse.jetty.security.ConstraintMapping\">\n  <property name=\"constraint\" ref=\"securityConstraint\" />\n  <property name=\"pathSpec\" value=\"/\" />\n</bean>\nOr we encourage users to upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 6.1.2 where the default configuration has been updated with authentication by default.",
