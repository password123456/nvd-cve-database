Using a software state to track whether or not we need to start\n   the process to exit idle or notify idle.\nIt's possible for the hardware to have exited an idle state without\ndriver knowledge, but entering one is always restricted to a driver\nallow - which makes the SW state vs HW state mismatch issue purely one\nof optimization, which should seldomly be hit, if at all.\n2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idle to use a single wrapper\n   that maintains this SW state.\nThis works simialr to dc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the\nDMCUB level and makes sure the state is marked prior to any notify/exit\nidle so we don't enter an infinite loop.\n3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending any commands or\n   waiting for DMCUB idle.\nThis patch takes care of 1/2. A future patch will take care of wrapping\nDMCUB command submission with calls to this new interface.",

The location of the second memory buffer may\ndiffer from the one allocated by the image kernel.\nWhen the restore kernel transfers control to the image kernel, its HFI\nbuffer becomes invalid, potentially leading to memory corruption if the\nhardware writes to it (the hardware continues to use the buffer from the\nrestore kernel).\nIt is also possible that the hardware \"forgets\" the address of the memory\nbuffer when resuming from \"deep\" suspend. Memory corruption may also occur\nin such a scenario.\nTo prevent the described memory corruption, disable HFI when preparing to\nsuspend or hibernate. Enable it when resuming.\nAdd syscore callbacks to handle the package of the boot CPU (packages of\nnon-boot CPUs are handled via CPU offline). Syscore ops always run on the\nboot CPU.
