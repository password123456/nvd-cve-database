This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ubermenu_delete_all_item_settings and ubermenu_reset_settings functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete and reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",

        "description": "An open redirect vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio, affecting the latest version. The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary websites, which can be exploited for phishing attacks, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), amongst others. This issue is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the handling of URLs. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that, when processed by the application, redirects the user to an attacker-controlled web page.",
