The vulnerability arises from insufficient input validation in the `/apply_settings` function, allowing an attacker to manipulate the `discussion_db_name` parameter to traverse the file system and include arbitrary files. This issue is compounded by the bypass of input filtering in the `install_binding`, `reinstall_binding`, and `unInstall_binding` endpoints, despite the presence of a `sanitize_path_from_endpoint(data.name)` filter. Successful exploitation enables an attacker to upload and execute malicious code on the victim's system, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
