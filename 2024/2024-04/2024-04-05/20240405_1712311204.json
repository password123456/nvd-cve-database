The igate mutex cannot be acquired from the\natomic context of the eventfd wake function.  Disabling the irqfd\nrelative to the eventfd registration is potentially incompatible with\nexisting userspace.\nAs a result, the solution implemented here moves configuration of the\nINTx interrupt handler to track the lifetime of the INTx context object\nand irq_type configuration, rather than registration of a particular\ntrigger eventfd.  Synchronization is added between the ioctl path and\neventfd_signal() wrapper such that the eventfd trigger can be\ndynamically updated relative to in-flight interrupts or irqfd callbacks.",
