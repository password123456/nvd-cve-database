In fact, only\ndevices in low power states should be polled.\nHowever there's still a requirement that the device config space must be\naccessible, which has implications for both the current state of the polled\ndevice and the parent bridge, when present.  It's not sufficient to assume\nthe bridge remains in D0 and cases have been observed where the bridge\npasses the D0 test, but the PM state indicates RPM_SUSPENDING and config\nspace of the polled device becomes inaccessible during pci_pme_wakeup().\nTherefore, since the bridge is already effectively required to be in the\nRPM_ACTIVE state, formalize this in the code and elevate the PM usage count\nto maintain the state while polling the subordinate device.\nThis resolves a regression reported in the bugzilla below where a\nThunderbolt/USB4 hierarchy fails to scan for an attached NVMe endpoint\ndownstream of a bridge in a D3hot power state.",

When the reverse proxy mode is enabled by the `IRONIC_REVERSE_PROXY_SETUP` variable set to `true`, 1) HTTP basic credentials are validated on the HTTPD side in a separate container, not in the Ironic service itself and 2) Ironic listens in host network on a private port 6388 on localhost by default. As a result, when the reverse proxy mode is used, any Pod or local Unix user on the control plane Node can access the Ironic API on the private port without authentication. A similar problem affects Ironic Inspector (`INSPECTOR_REVERSE_PROXY_SETUP` set to `true`), although the attack potential is smaller there. This issue affects operators deploying ironic-image in the reverse proxy mode, which is the recommended mode when TLS is used (also recommended), with the `IRONIC_PRIVATE_PORT` variable unset or set to a numeric value. In this case, an attacker with enough privileges to launch a pod on the control plane with host networking can access Ironic API and use it to modify bare-metal machine, e.g. provision them with a new image or change their BIOS settings. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.1.1. ",
