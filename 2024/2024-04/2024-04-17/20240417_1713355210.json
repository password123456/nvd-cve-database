If that mount had a parent then verify that the caller and the\nmount namespace the mount is attached to match and if not make sure that\nit's an anonymous mount.\nThe real rootfs falls into neither category. It is neither an anoymous\nmount because it is obviously attached to the initial mount namespace\nbut it also obviously doesn't have a parent mount. So that means legacy\nmount(2) allows changing mount properties on the real rootfs but\nmount_setattr(2) blocks this. I never thought much about this but of\ncourse someone on this planet of earth changes properties on the real\nrootfs as can be seen in [1].\nSince util-linux finally switched to the new mount api in 2.39 not so\nlong ago it also relies on mount_setattr() and that surfaced this issue\nwhen Fedora 39 finally switched to it.

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: bridge: switchdev: Skip MDB replays of deferred events on offload\nBefore this change, generation of the list of MDB events to replay\nwould race against the creation of new group memberships, either from\nthe IGMP/MLD snooping logic or from user configuration.\nWhile new memberships are immediately visible to walkers of\nbr->mdb_list, the notification of their existence to switchdev event\nsubscribers is deferred until a later point in time. So if a replay\nlist was generated during a time that overlapped with such a window,\nit would also contain a replay of the not-yet-delivered event.\nThe driver would thus receive two copies of what the bridge internally\nconsidered to be one single event. On destruction of the bridge, only\na single membership deletion event was therefore sent. As a\nconsequence of this, drivers which reference count memberships (at\nleast DSA), would be left with orphan groups in their hardware\ndatabase when the bridge was destroyed.\nThis is only an issue when replaying additions. While deletion events\nmay still be pending on the deferred queue, they will already have\nbeen removed from br->mdb_list, so no duplicates can be generated in\nthat scenario.\nTo a user this meant that old group memberships, from a bridge in\nwhich a port was previously attached, could be reanimated (in\nhardware) when the port joined a new bridge, without the new bridge's\nknowledge.\nFor example, on an mv88e6xxx system, create a snooping bridge and\nimmediately add a port to it:\n    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br0 up type bridge mcast_snooping 1 && \\\n    > ip link set dev x3 up master br0\nAnd then destroy the bridge:\n    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link del dev br0\n    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ mvls atu\n    ADDRESS             FID  STATE      Q  F  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a\n    DEV:0 Marvell 88E6393X\n    33:33:00:00:00:6a     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n    33:33:ff:87:e4:3f     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n    ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff     1  static     -  -  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a\n    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$\nThe two IPv6 groups remain in the hardware database because the\nport (x3) is notified of the host's membership twice: once via the\noriginal event and once via a replay. Since only a single delete\nnotification is sent, the count remains at 1 when the bridge is\ndestroyed.\nThen add the same port (or another port belonging to the same hardware\ndomain) to a new bridge, this time with snooping disabled:\n    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br1 up type bridge mcast_snooping 0 && \\\n    > ip link set dev x3 up master br1\nAll multicast, including the two IPv6 groups from br0, should now be\nflooded, according to the policy of br1. But instead the old\nmemberships are still active in the hardware database, causing the\nswitch to only forward traffic to those groups towards the CPU (port\n0).\nEliminate the race in two steps:\n1. Grab the write-side lock of the MDB while generating the replay\n   list.\nThis prevents new memberships from showing up while we are generating\nthe replay list. But it leaves the scenario in which a deferred event\nwas already generated, but not delivered, before we grabbed the\nlock. Therefore:\n2. Make sure that no deferred version of a replay event is already\n   enqueued to the switchdev deferred queue, before adding it to the\n   replay list, when replaying additions.",

E.g.\nblktests is able to reproduce the situation where the module unload\nhangs forever.\nIf we completely rely on the cleanup code executed from the\nnvme_delete_ctrl path, all IDs will be freed eventually. This makes\ncalling ida_destroy unnecessary. We only have to ensure that all\nnvme_delete_ctrl code has been executed before we leave\nnvme_fc_exit_module.

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nigc: avoid returning frame twice in XDP_REDIRECT\nWhen a frame can not be transmitted in XDP_REDIRECT\n(e.g. due to a full queue), it is necessary to free\nit by calling xdp_return_frame_rx_napi.\nHowever, this is the responsibility of the caller of\nthe ndo_xdp_xmit (see for example bq_xmit_all in\nkernel/bpf/devmap.c) and thus calling it inside\nigc_xdp_xmit (which is the ndo_xdp_xmit of the igc\ndriver) as well will lead to memory corruption.\nIn fact, bq_xmit_all expects that it can return all\nframes after the last successfully transmitted one.\nTherefore, break for the first not transmitted frame,\nbut do not call xdp_return_frame_rx_napi in igc_xdp_xmit.\nThis is equally implemented in other Intel drivers\nsuch as the igb.\nThere are two alternatives to this that were rejected:\n1. Return num_frames as all the frames would have been\n   transmitted and release them inside igc_xdp_xmit.\n   While it might work technically, it is not what\n   the return value is meant to represent (i.e. the\n   number of SUCCESSFULLY transmitted packets).\n2. Rework kernel/bpf/devmap.c and all drivers to\n   support non-consecutively dropped packets.\n   Besides being complex, it likely has a negative\n   performance impact without a significant gain\n   since it is anyway unlikely that the next frame\n   can be transmitted if the previous one was dropped.\nThe memory corruption can be reproduced with\nthe following script which leads to a kernel panic\nafter a few seconds.  It basically generates more\ntraffic than a i225 NIC can transmit and pushes it\nvia XDP_REDIRECT from a virtual interface to the\nphysical interface where frames get dropped.\n   #!/bin/bash\n   INTERFACE=enp4s0\n   INTERFACE_IDX=`cat /sys/class/net/$INTERFACE/ifindex`\n   sudo ip link add dev veth1 type veth peer name veth2\n   sudo ip link set up $INTERFACE\n   sudo ip link set up veth1\n   sudo ip link set up veth2\n   cat << EOF > redirect.bpf.c\n   SEC(\"prog\")\n   int redirect(struct xdp_md *ctx)\n   {\n       return bpf_redirect($INTERFACE_IDX, 0);\n   }\n   char _license[] SEC(\"license\") = \"GPL\";\n   EOF\n   clang -O2 -g -Wall -target bpf -c redirect.bpf.c -o redirect.bpf.o\n   sudo ip link set veth2 xdp obj redirect.bpf.o\n   cat << EOF > pass.bpf.c\n   SEC(\"prog\")\n   int pass(struct xdp_md *ctx)\n   {\n       return XDP_PASS;\n   }\n   char _license[] SEC(\"license\") = \"GPL\";\n   EOF\n   clang -O2 -g -Wall -target bpf -c pass.bpf.c -o pass.bpf.o\n   sudo ip link set $INTERFACE xdp obj pass.bpf.o\n   cat << EOF > trafgen.cfg\n   {\n     /* Ethernet Header */\n     0xe8, 0x6a, 0x64, 0x41, 0xbf, 0x46,\n     0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF,\n     const16(ETH_P_IP),\n     /* IPv4 Header */\n     0b01000101, 0,   # IPv4 version, IHL, TOS\n     const16(1028),   # IPv4 total length (UDP length + 20 bytes (IP header))\n     const16(2),      # IPv4 ident\n     0b01000000, 0,   # IPv4 flags, fragmentation off\n     64,              # IPv4 TTL\n     17,              # Protocol UDP\n     csumip(14, 33),  # IPv4 checksum\n     /* UDP Header */\n     10,  0, 1, 1,    # IP Src - adapt as needed\n     10,  0, 1, 2,    # IP Dest - adapt as needed\n     const16(6666),   # UDP Src Port\n     const16(6666),   # UDP Dest Port\n     const16(1008),   # UDP length (UDP header 8 bytes + payload length)\n     csumudp(14, 34), # UDP checksum\n     /* Payload */\n     fill('W', 1000),\n   }\n   EOF\n   sudo trafgen -i trafgen.cfg -b3000MB -o veth1 --cpp",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nrds: tcp: Fix use-after-free of net in reqsk_timer_handler().\nsyzkaller reported a warning of netns tracker [0] followed by KASAN\nsplat [1] and another ref tracker warning [1].\nsyzkaller could not find a repro, but in the log, the only suspicious\nsequence was as follows:\n  18:26:22 executing program 1:\n  r0 = socket$inet6_mptcp(0xa, 0x1, 0x106)\n  ...\n  connect$inet6(r0, &(0x7f0000000080)={0xa, 0x4001, 0x0, @loopback}, 0x1c) (async)\nThe notable thing here is 0x4001 in connect(), which is RDS_TCP_PORT.\nSo, the scenario would be:\n  1. unshare(CLONE_NEWNET) creates a per netns tcp listener in\n      rds_tcp_listen_init().\n  2. syz-executor connect()s to it and creates a reqsk.\n  3. syz-executor exit()s immediately.\n  4. netns is dismantled.  [0]\n  5. reqsk timer is fired, and UAF happens while freeing reqsk.  [1]\n  6. listener is freed after RCU grace period.  [2]\nBasically, reqsk assumes that the listener guarantees netns safety\nuntil all reqsk timers are expired by holding the listener's refcount.\nHowever, this was not the case for kernel sockets.\nCommit 740ea3c4a0b2 (\"tcp: Clean up kernel listener's reqsk in\ninet_twsk_purge()\") fixed this issue only for per-netns ehash.\nLet's apply the same fix for the global ehash.\n[0]:\nref_tracker: net notrefcnt@0000000065449cc3 has 1/1 users at\n     sk_alloc (./include/net/net_namespace.h:337 net/core/sock.c:2146)\n     inet6_create (net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:192 net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:119)\n     __sock_create (net/socket.c:1572)\n     rds_tcp_listen_init (net/rds/tcp_listen.c:279)\n     rds_tcp_init_net (net/rds/tcp.c:577)\n     ops_init (net/core/net_namespace.c:137)\n     setup_net (net/core/net_namespace.c:340)\n     copy_net_ns (net/core/net_namespace.c:497)\n     create_new_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:110)\n     unshare_nsproxy_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:228 (discriminator 4))\n     ksys_unshare (kernel/fork.c:3429)\n     __x64_sys_unshare (kernel/fork.c:3496)\n     do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83)\n     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:129)\n...\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 27 at lib/ref_tracker.c:179 ref_tracker_dir_exit (lib/ref_tracker.c:179)\n[1]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop (./include/net/inet_hashtables.h:180 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:952 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:966)\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff88801b370400 by task swapper/0/0\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nCall Trace:\n <IRQ>\n dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:107 (discriminator 1))\n print_report (mm/kasan/report.c:378 mm/kasan/report.c:488)\n kasan_report (mm/kasan/report.c:603)\n inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop (./include/net/inet_hashtables.h:180 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:952 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:966)\n reqsk_timer_handler (net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:979 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1092)\n call_timer_fn (./arch/x86/include/asm/jump_label.h:27 ./include/linux/jump_label.h:207 ./include/trace/events/timer.h:127 kernel/time/timer.c:1701)\n __run_timers.part.0 (kernel/time/timer.c:1752 kernel/time/timer.c:2038)\n run_timer_softirq (kernel/time/timer.c:2053)\n __do_softirq (./arch/x86/include/asm/jump_label.h:27 ./include/linux/jump_label.h:207 ./include/trace/events/irq.h:142 kernel/softirq.c:554)\n irq_exit_rcu (kernel/softirq.c:427 kernel/softirq.c:632 kernel/softirq.c:644)\n sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt (arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1076 (discriminator 14))\n </IRQ>\nAllocated by task 258 on cpu 0 at 83.612050s:\n kasan_save_stack (mm/kasan/common.c:48)\n kasan_save_track (mm/kasan/common.c:68)\n __kasan_slab_alloc (mm/kasan/common.c:343)\n kmem_cache_alloc (mm/slub.c:3813 mm/slub.c:3860 mm/slub.c:3867)\n copy_net_ns (./include/linux/slab.h:701 net/core/net_namespace.c:421 net/core/net_namespace.c:480)\n create_new_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:110)\n unshare_nsproxy_name\n---truncated---",

The refactoring\nremoved that logic and the flag, as subdev_8255_mm_init() and\nsubdev_8255_io_init() now explicitly pass subdev_8255_mmio and\nsubdev_8255_io respectively to __subdev_8255_init(), only\n__subdev_8255_init() never sets spriv->io to the supplied\ncallback. That spriv->io is NULL leads to a later BUG:\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\nPGD 0 P4D 0\nOops: 0010 [#1] SMP PTI\nCPU: 1 PID: 1210 Comm: systemd-udevd Not tainted 6.7.3-x86_64 #1\nHardware name: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nRIP: 0010:0x0\nCode: Unable to access opcode bytes at 0xffffffffffffffd6.\nRSP: 0018:ffffa3f1c02d7b78 EFLAGS: 00010202\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff91f847aefd00 RCX: 000000000000009b\nRDX: 0000000000000003 RSI: 0000000000000001 RDI: ffff91f840f6fc00\nRBP: ffff91f840f6fc00 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000001\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 000000000000005f R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffffffffc0102498 R15: ffff91f847ce6ba8\nFS:  00007f72f4e8f500(0000) GS:ffff91f8d5c80000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: ffffffffffffffd6 CR3: 000000010540e000 CR4: 00000000000406f0\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n ? __die_body+0x15/0x57\n ? page_fault_oops+0x2ef/0x33c\n ? insert_vmap_area.constprop.0+0xb6/0xd5\n ? alloc_vmap_area+0x529/0x5ee\n ? exc_page_fault+0x15a/0x489\n ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30\n __subdev_8255_init+0x79/0x8d [comedi_8255]\n pci_8255_auto_attach+0x11a/0x139 [8255_pci]\n comedi_auto_config+0xac/0x117 [comedi]\n ? __pfx___driver_attach+0x10/0x10\n pci_device_probe+0x88/0xf9\n really_probe+0x101/0x248\n __driver_probe_device+0xbb/0xed\n driver_probe_device+0x1a/0x72\n __driver_attach+0xd4/0xed\n bus_for_each_dev+0x76/0xb8\n bus_add_driver+0xbe/0x1be\n driver_register+0x9a/0xd8\n comedi_pci_driver_register+0x28/0x48 [comedi_pci]\n ? __pfx_pci_8255_driver_init+0x10/0x10 [8255_pci]\n do_one_initcall+0x72/0x183\n do_init_module+0x5b/0x1e8\n init_module_from_file+0x86/0xac\n __do_sys_finit_module+0x151/0x218\n do_syscall_64+0x72/0xdb\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x76\nRIP: 0033:0x7f72f50a0cb9\nCode: ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 44 00 00 48 89 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05 <48> 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d 47 71 0c 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48\nRSP: 002b:00007ffd47e512d8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000139\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000562dd06ae070 RCX: 00007f72f50a0cb9\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 00007f72f52d32df RDI: 000000000000000e\nRBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 00007f72f5168b20 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000050 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00007f72f52d32df\nR13: 0000000000020000 R14: 0000562dd06785c0 R15: 0000562dcfd0e9a8\n </TASK>\nModules linked in: 8255_pci(+) comedi_8255 comedi_pci comedi intel_gtt e100(+) acpi_cpufreq rtc_cmos usbhid\nCR2: 0000000000000000\n---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\nRIP: 0010:0x0\nCode: Unable to access opcode bytes at 0xffffffffffffffd6.\nRSP: 0018:ffffa3f1c02d7b78 EFLAGS: 00010202\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff91f847aefd00 RCX: 000000000000009b\nRDX: 0000000000000003 RSI: 0000000000000001 RDI: ffff91f840f6fc00\nRBP: ffff91f840f6fc00 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000001\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 000000000000005f R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffffffffc0102498 R15: ffff91f847ce6ba8\nFS: \n---truncated---",

The second call attempts to remove the\n\"hash_list\" entry from a list, while it was already removed by the first\ncall.\nFix __dm_internal_resume so that it calls the preresume and resume\nmethods of the table's targets.\nIf a preresume method of some target fails, we are in a tricky situation.\nWe can't return an error because dm_internal_resume isn't supposed to\nreturn errors. We can't return success, because then the \"resume\" and\n\"postsuspend\" methods would not be paired correctly. So, we set the\nDMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuse userspace\ntools, but it won't cause a kernel crash.\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nkernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:56!\ninvalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\nCPU: 1 PID: 8343 Comm: dmsetup Not tainted 6.8.0-rc6 #4\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-2 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n<snip>\nRSP: 0018:ffff8881b831bcc0 EFLAGS: 00010282\nRAX: 000000000000004e RBX: ffff888143b6eb80 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffffffff819053d0 RDI: 00000000ffffffff\nRBP: ffff8881b83a3400 R08: 00000000fffeffff R09: 0000000000000058\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffffffff81a24080 R12: 0000000000000001\nR13: ffff88814538e000 R14: ffff888143bc6dc0 R15: ffffffffa02e4bb0\nFS:  00000000f7c0f780(0000) GS:ffff8893f0a40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 002b ES: 002b CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 0000000057fb5000 CR3: 0000000143474000 CR4: 00000000000006b0\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n ? die+0x2d/0x80\n ? do_trap+0xeb/0xf0\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? do_error_trap+0x60/0x80\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x49/0x60\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod]\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n origin_postsuspend+0x1a/0x50 [dm_snapshot]\n dm_table_postsuspend_targets+0x34/0x50 [dm_mod]\n dm_suspend+0xd8/0xf0 [dm_mod]\n dev_suspend+0x1f2/0x2f0 [dm_mod]\n ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod]\n ctl_ioctl+0x300/0x5f0 [dm_mod]\n dm_compat_ctl_ioctl+0x7/0x10 [dm_mod]\n __x64_compat_sys_ioctl+0x104/0x170\n do_syscall_64+0x184/0x1b0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0x4e\nRIP: 0033:0xf7e6aead\n<snip>\n---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbpf: Fix stackmap overflow check on 32-bit arches\nThe stackmap code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number\nof hash buckets, and contains an overflow check by checking if the\nresulting value is 0.

When unregistering a net device, since the needs_free_netdev has\nbeen set to true during registration, the netdevice object is also freed,\nand as a consequence, the corresponding vif object too, since it is\nattached to it as private netdevice data. The next occurrence of the loop\nthen tries to access freed vif pointer to the list to move forward in the\nlist.\nFix this use-after-free thanks to two mechanisms:\n- navigate in the list with list_for_each_entry_safe, which allows to\n  safely modify the list as we go through each element. For each element,\n  remove it from the list with list_del_rcu\n- make sure to wait for RCU grace period end after each vif removal to make\n  sure it is safe to free the corresponding vif too (through\n  unregister_netdev)\nSince we are in a RCU \"modifier\" path (not a \"reader\" path), and because\nsuch path is expected not to be concurrent to any other modifier (we are\nusing the vif_mutex lock), we do not need to use RCU list API, that's why\nwe can benefit from list_for_each_entry_safe.\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/ab077dbe58b1ea5de0a3b2ca21f275a07af967d2.camel@egauge.net/",

It\nseems syzbot managed to trigger the race for one of the other commands as well,\nso let's just move the existing synchronisation bit to cover the whole\ntasklet (setting it at the end of ath9k_htc_probe_device() instead of inside\nath9k_tx_init()).",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\naoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts\nThis patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:\n  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux\n  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on\n  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing\n  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`\n  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or\n  potential code execution.\nIn aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial\ncode is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in\nlater tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the\ndev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb\ninitial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into\nuse-after-free because the net_device is freed.\nThis patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in\naoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().",

By comparing the packets from a\nnormal connection and disconnection process with the testcase that\ntriggered a KASAN report. We analyzed the cause of this bug as follows:\n1. In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a\n`Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet\n(Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of\nencryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately\nreplies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the\nEncryption Key Size.\n2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this\npacket was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP\nlayers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected.\n3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described\nin point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function.\nHowever, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;`\nhad already been released, and when the function executed\n`return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`,\nspecifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred.\nTo fix this bug, check if `sk->sk_state` is BT_CLOSED before calling\nrfcomm_recv_frame in rfcomm_process_rx.",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nsoc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix drm bridge use-after-free\nA recent DRM series purporting to simplify support for \"transparent\nbridges\" and handling of probe deferrals ironically exposed a\nuse-after-free issue on pmic_glink_altmode probe deferral.\nThis has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing\nto initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like\nthe Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.\nSpecifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all\nresources have been acquired which means that it can also be\nderegistered on probe deferrals.\nIn the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver\n(or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and\nstored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to\nbe deallocated.\nWhen the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a\nuse-after-free when attaching the bridges:\n\tdp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)\nwhich may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:\n\t[drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16\nor a NULL-pointer dereference:\n\tUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000\n\t...\n\tCall trace:\n\t  drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]\n\t  drm_aux_bridge_attach+0x24/0x38 [aux_bridge]\n\t  drm_bridge_attach+0x80/0x1a8 [drm]\n\t  dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]\n\t  msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]\nThe DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on\nthe assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is\nto move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to\nafter all resources have been looked up.\nIncidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers\nchild devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue\nin driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see\ncommit fbc35b45f9f6 (\"Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER\")).\n[DB: slightly fixed commit message by adding the word 'commit']",
