The problem\narises from the following sequence.\n        1. In dwc3_gadget_suspend, there is a chance of a timeout when\n        moving the USB core to the halt state after clearing the\n        run/stop bit by software.\n        2. In dwc3_core_exit, the event buffer is cleared regardless of\n        the USB core's status, which may lead to an SMMU faults and\n        other memory issues. if the USB core tries to access the event\n        buffer address.\nTo prevent this hardware quirk on Exynos platforms, this commit ensures\nthat the event buffer address is not cleared by software  when the USB\ncore is active during runtime suspend by checking its status before\nclearing the buffer address.",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ndrm/xe: prevent UAF around preempt fence\nThe fence lock is part of the queue, therefore in the current design\nanything locking the fence should then also hold a ref to the queue to\nprevent the queue from being freed.\nHowever, currently it looks like we signal the fence and then drop the\nqueue ref, but if something is waiting on the fence, the waiter is\nkicked to wake up at some later point, where upon waking up it first\ngrabs the lock before checking the fence state. But if we have already\ndropped the queue ref, then the lock might already be freed as part of\nthe queue, leading to uaf.\nTo prevent this, move the fence lock into the fence itself so we don't\nrun into lifetime issues. Alternative might be to have device level\nlock, or only release the queue in the fence release callback, however\nthat might require pushing to another worker to avoid locking issues.\nReferences: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/xe/kernel/-/issues/2454\nReferences: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/xe/kernel/-/issues/2342\nReferences: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/xe/kernel/-/issues/2020\n(cherry picked from commit 7116c35aacedc38be6d15bd21b2fc936eed0008b)",

Enter btrfs_submit_bio() with a read bio\n   The read bio length is 128K, crossing two 64K stripes.\n2. The first run of btrfs_submit_chunk()\n2.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which returns 64K\n2.2 Call btrfs_split_bio()\n    Now there are two bios, one referring to the first 64K, the other\n    referring to the second 64K.\n2.3 The first half is submitted.\n3. The second run of btrfs_submit_chunk()\n3.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which by somehow failed\n    Now we call btrfs_bio_end_io() to handle the error\n3.2 btrfs_bio_end_io() calls the original endio function\n    Which is end_bbio_data_read(), and it calls bio_put() for the\n    original bio.\n    Now the original bio is freed.\n4. The submitted first 64K bio finished\n   Now we call into btrfs_check_read_bio() and tries to advance the bio\n   iter.\n   But since the original bio (thus its iter) is already freed, we\n   trigger the above use-after free.\n   And even if the memory is not poisoned/corrupted, we will later call\n   the original endio function, causing a double freeing.\n[FIX]\nInstead of calling btrfs_bio_end_io(), call btrfs_orig_bbio_end_io(),\nwhich has the extra check on split bios and do the pr\n---truncated---",
