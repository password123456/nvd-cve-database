A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\n Note: This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers and Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers if they are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 17.12.1 or 17.12.1a.",
